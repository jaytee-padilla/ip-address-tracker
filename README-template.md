### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- IMPORTANT NOTE: The free tier of the IP Geolocation API is limited to 1000 credits (a.k.a requests). If the API is no longer loading content properly, it's more than likely because the free credits have run dry
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location
- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### What I learned

- How to implement .env files in a pure client side project (i.e. Doesn't implement a backend or node)

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
